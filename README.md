# Face Recognition System using Matlab
This project aims to develop a Face Recognition System which will classify the face images. For the implementation of this project, all the codes have been written in the Matlab2017a environment. This project is consisting of three phases: Feature Extraction from face Image using Linear Binary Pattern, Dimensionality reduction using PCA algorithm and Classify using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifier. For feature extraction divide the image 8*8 block, and from each block select 59 uniform features using extractLBPFeatures() Matlab function.These results are obtained using LFWCropped20 face image data set. From this results, it was observed that the Naive Bayes classifier perform better than KNN classifier.
